description: "Here I am exploring the possiblities of a code-driven,
  schema-first CMS in combination with hybrid rendering
  strategies from NextJS with Stitches for a fast and
  responive developer experience. My motivation is
  finding a possible replacement for WordPress in a headless
  usecase with a powerful and flexible document editor."
